    "data_description": "In a study to determine the causal effect of sending an email reminder on the repayment of debts, a fintech company conducted a random test involving 5000 customers who were late on their payments. Each customer was randomly assigned to either receive an email about negotiating their debt or to be part of a control group that did not receive the email. Data was collected on the amounts paid by the late customers after this intervention. The dataset collections_email.csv contains variables including the amount paid (`payments`), whether the email was sent (`email`), whether the email was opened (`opened`), whether the customer contacted the collections department to negotiate their debt after having received the email (`agreement`), the customer's credit limit before being late (`credit_limit`), and the customer's risk score prior to the delivery of the email (`risk_score`).",
    "question": "What is the average treatment effect (ATE) on payments from sending the email reminder to late-paying customers? Please choose the variables to adjust for.",
    "answer": "4.43",
